# Cautious Adventure
A remake of my portfolio website using a different framework.

## React
It uses the `react` framework from NPM.

Pros:
- reactive content
- most popular JS framework.

## Firebase
The website used the `firebase` package.

It displays content loaded from a remote nosql database. The website also has authentication. This allows users with the adequate permissions to edit the content of the website.

Pros:
- store the content remotely
- add security with authentication
- store custom user content

## Markdown
It uses the `react-markdown` package.

The idea is to write the content for each of the static pages in a separate file. This file is written in markdown, a lightweight markup language. This provides plain text formatting syntax that is human readable.

Pros:
- decouple the site from its content (could be even be remote)
- quickly scaffold and test
- easier to proofread than html code
