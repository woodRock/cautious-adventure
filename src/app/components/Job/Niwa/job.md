[NIWA](https://niwa.co.nz/about/our-company), the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, is a Crown Research Institute established in 1992. It operates as a stand-alone company with its own Board of Directors and Executive.

**Role:** Volunteer Work Experience

My work experience involved developing a geographic information system (GIS). This used the [Mapserver](https://mapserver.org/) framework to create a web map service (WMS) to render data stored on a [postgis](https://postgis.net/) database. An example of this workflow can be found on my github [here](https://github.com/woodRock/solid-waffle).
