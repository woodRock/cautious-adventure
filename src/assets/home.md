## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My goal is to leave the world a better place than I found it. I plan to bring that goal into reality by creating technology which improves the quality of life. These goals have motivated my passion for software engineering and the open-source community as a tool for sharing knowledge. This objective has led me to a voluntary internship at NIWA, collaborating with scientists and physicists to publish their research on our oceans and atmosphere to a global audience. Software is a medium to explore my scientific curiosity and contribute a meaningful change.
