#  Mac's Brewery

They are the flagship bar for New Zealand's Mac's beer. [Mac's](https://macs.co.nz/our-story/) is a function centre, restaurant and bar.

**Roles:** bartender, barista, functions, waiter, kp & glassy

This was my first job. I started with no work experience, and steadily progressed through the company. I learnt valuable communication, event coordination and conflict resolution skills.
